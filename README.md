What you'll probably notice from the very beginning when you run the program 
is that the shadows will sometimes look a bit ugly. At least on my computer 
they look very pixelated, and sometimes they seem to stretch out, 
forming new and "interesting" shapes. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure 
out what is causing the problem, but I've yet to find a fix for it. 

Something else that I also could have improved would be the visualization of the FBO depth texture, 
that appears when the user presses 't' on the keyboard. I would prefer that only the white part 
of the texture was semi-transparent, so that the darker parts would have been more visible.
I would also prefer to remove some of the white-space from this visualization, 
because the interesting parts are in the center.

For the rest of my solution, I have so say that I am very happy with what I've accomplished, 
I think I've everything else correctly and in a reasonably/elegant way.
