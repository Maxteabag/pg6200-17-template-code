PG6200 Template Code for the Autumn 2017

This code has implemented many of the features encountered throughout the PG6200 subject.
For students this code is intended to be forked, in preference to cloning, which gives each student a stand alone template of their liking.

If you encounter bugs or have added new features/cleaned up some code and want to share the progress with the rest of the class, make a pull-request and I will look over the modifications and add it to the HEAD of the repo.
